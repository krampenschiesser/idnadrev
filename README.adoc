== About ==

Idnadrev is a task management and knowledge application
that helps to organize your ideas, projects and any kind of information.
It is also a test project for an activity based JavaFX dialog framework.
I am currently working on the API and slowly moving forward to get the first version running.
So this is active development and nothing to use, yet.

== Building ==

Building idnadrev is based on http://www.gradle.org/[gradle].
If you don't have gradle installed, no worries.
Use the provided gradle wrapper *gradlew*
[source,shell]

$ ./gradlew help
